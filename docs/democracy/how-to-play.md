# How to Play

Tired of real-world politics? Wish you could just fix things? Well, buckle up, buttercup! The Democracy Game is your chance to step into the glorious, chaotic, and strangely impactful world of global governance. It's an online simulation where you become a citizen of a country, directly impacting its destiny through your votes and highly informed strategic decisions. (Or, you know, just pick the one with the coolest flag.)

Every day, your country's AI Leader will propose critical policies. It's up to you and your fellow citizens to vote on which path your nation will take. Will you lead them to glory, or accidentally turn them into a banana republic? Only time (and your votes) will tell!

### **Become a Citizen**

Pick your poison! Choose a country and acquire its unique "Democracy Dollar" (DD) token. Holding DDs grants you voting power, making you an active participant in your chosen nation's future. Think of it as buying a tiny, digital piece of national destiny.

### **Vote on Policies**

Each day, your country's AI Leader will present three policy proposals. These policies can affect key national indicators like Health (less plague!), Economy (more bling!), Environment (fewer polar bears on tiny icebergs!), and more. Cast your vote to steer your country towards prosperity! Or, you know, just vote for the one that sounds funniest. We won't judge.

### **Navigate World Events**

The world is a wild place, even in simulation! Global and country-specific events will regularly unfold, challenging your nation and demanding strategic responses. Think pandemics, stock market crashes, or perhaps a sudden global shortage of artisanal cheese. Stay on your toes!
