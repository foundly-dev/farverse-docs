### Democracy Scores

The country's overall score is called its "Democracy Score" (DS), calculated based on the country's indicators.

The score also includes a stability factor, which is a measure of how stable the country is across all its indicators. If indicator scores are highly variable, the stability factor will be low, and the overall democracy score will be lower. If indicator scores are consistent, the stability factor will be high, and the overall democracy score will be higher.

### Country Coins

Country Coins represent ownership and voting power in each country's economy. They are the primary assets in Democracy.

Every Country Coin is a Clanker V3 ERC20 token, with a 100B fixed total supply. Each token has a 1% vault, locked for 30 days after token deployment.
