# Proposals

Proposals are policy changes that players can vote on to influence country governance and economics. Each day, each country's leader will generate three new proposals. Each proposal can affect up to 3 country indicators positively or negatively +- 3 points.

Proposals are influenced by the current game state (a country's current indicators, score, stability), the leader's persona and traits, and recent global events.

Voting is open for 23 hours after the proposal is generated. 1 hour is reserved at the end of each day (11pm UTC - 12am UTC) to allow for counting, processing and new proposal generation. Each citizen can choose one proposal to succeed. Votes are tallied based on voting power and the winning proposal is executed at the end of the day.

You can always see the number of citizens who have voted on a proposal, but not their voting power.

### Voting Power

Your voting power is determined by the number of Country Coins you hold. Voting power starts at 1 vote for 1M tokens, increasing using a quadratic voting formular to curve overall voting power. Voting Power is capped at 30 votes per citizen.

Final voting power is calculated at the end of the day during the voting period. If your balance changes before the end of the day, your voting power will be updated. If your voting power reaches 0, your vote will not be counted.

Additional boosts can be gained which can temporarily increase your voting power for a given time period, e.g sharing your vote each day to get a +1 boost.
