# How to Play

Click Button -> Earn Rewards

### 1. Pick an enemy

Browse the enemies list and open one to view its details, health, and rewards. New enemies are added regularly. Some are for everyone, some are only available if you meet certain criteria.

### 2. Attack & Earn

Attack the enemy. Each successful attack deals damage and instantly sends you rewards. Attacking is free, you just pay the gas fee.

### 3. Watch Your Health

Enemies will also hit you back. If your healthbar reaches zero you won't be able to attack again until tomorrow. Health resets every 12 hours at 7am and 7pm UTC. You can also use items to heal up if you can't wait that long.

### 4. Collect & Equip Items

Throughout your gameplay you will collect items. These can increase your attack, health, hit rate, and critical hit chance. Equip them by opening an item in your inventory

### 5. Attack Again!

Your attacks have a cooldown specific to each enemy. You will see a timer indicating how long you have to wait until you can attack again.

## Tips

A few things to keep in mind on your quests

1. Enemy Health = Loot. The more health, the more rewards available to earn.
2. Enable notifications to be notified when new enemies are available and when you can attack again.
3. Share your attacks with friends.
4. An enemy is "slain" when it's health reaches 0 and there are not more tokens available.
5. Attacking is free, you just pay the gas fee. Exact token rewards may be worth more or less than the gas fee you pay depending on the enemy and current market price.
